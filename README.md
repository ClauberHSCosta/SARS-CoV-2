# Conformational Dynamics and Binding Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variants: Omicron, XBB.1.9.2 and EG.5

Description
This repository contains data and analyses from our investigation into the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus, focusing on the molecular interactions between its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human ACE2 receptor. We examined wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron, XBB.1.9.2, and EG.5 variants, employing computational approaches such as Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD), Free Energy calculations, and Interaction Fingerprint (IFP) analysis.
